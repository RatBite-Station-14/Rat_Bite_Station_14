# Welcome to RatBite!

  This server is designed to let you be free to do whatever you want. While there are many fun situations for people playing or role-playing normally, we're making self-antagonism fun, for both the person doing it and the person targeted by it!

Follow this basic set of rules and whether you're a normal player, a griefer, shitsec, power gamer, or whatever, you'll be welcome to test your limits within the game design with only in-game consequences. Do that which makes the time you spend here a good time!


## SERVER RULES

  - 1. Abandon your preconceptions from other servers. You are free to do whatever you want here, but with in-game consequences. The only exceptions are these basic rules.

  - 2. Central Command actively mindshields and monitors its employees through trackers/recorders and controls them through kill switches, so if you choose to play as part of CC (ERT, NTR, BSO,) you MUST follow your role’s SOP and orders to the letter. You aren't required to follow them in spirit however, – otherwise known as being ‘Maliciously Compliant’. – Roleban.

  - 3. As part of the Command or Security personnel you are actively mindshielded but are not monitored like direct employees of CC are. You may act outside the law and abuse your power, but can face in-character repercussions if your actions are witnessed and reported. Basically, as sec/command, do NOT grief the station en-masse or round remove people for no reason. – Warning/Roleban.

  - 4. No exposing relevant game info you should not know via meta-communications. (discord or other voice chat applications) You may play with friends and share basic information in close proximity within reason, just explain it as just being really in tune with your buddy, but DO NOT speak to your pal from the dead or give vital info over vast distances without a radio. – Warning/Ban.

  - 5. We use a basic New Life Rule.. However you may remember past rounds,  so general resentment and metagrudge from past rounds is permitted to keep everyone feeling the social consequences of their actions, BUT do not use knowledge from your previous life/death during the CURRENT round to meta-grudge and impact the round unless directed to by an AHelp message. – Warning/Ban.

  - 6. You are allowed to make edgy jokes, say mild slurs in-character, and engage in any degree of in-game speciesism. However, do NOT say real life slurs OOC, use extreme real world slurs with malicious or obnoxious results, ceaselessly harass someone on the basis of their minority status, or bring your genuine biases into the game. The community will make a fool out of you and if your offense was bad enough you will be warned/banned.. – Warning/Ban.
  
  - 7. Do not engage in ERP. Romantic RP or ‘E-Dating’ is allowed only if you know the other person and it remains non-graphic, you don’t know their age or the effect these things will have on people if you do not know them personally. – Ban.
  
  - 8. Silicons must follow their laws. Similarly, characters who are mind controlled or under similar effects that dictate their behaviour must obey their master and/or laws. Failure to comply will result in your character being treated as defective/uncontrolled and your maker/master will be compensated for their loss. – Warning/Ban.

  - 9. No boring complete station destruction/extreme raiding behavior in the first 15 minutes. You may still be a general scumbag and get into fights. Security, command, and CC may still arrest or do whatever they want if they see you acting suspiciously during this period so there’s no real getting around this. – Ban.
