# For later when cybernetics are added, allow protogens to have 1 module slot, generic modules only. **MAYBE** have a cell required to use said modules
# Also, maybe special "nanite" versions of whatever the module gives are used instead of the real tool. I.E nanite crowbar thats 2x slower than a regular crowbar (so its balanced-ish)
